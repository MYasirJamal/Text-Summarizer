# Text Summarization using Transformers
## Overview
This project implements a text summarization model using transformer-based architectures from scratch. The purpose of the model is to generate concise and coherent summaries of input text documents by leveraging transformer models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Keras
- transformers
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Math

## Usage
- Install all libraries
- Input your data in the get_ds() function
- Compile the build_model() function to build the transformer model
- Modify the get_config() function to provide your custom configurations for number of epochs, batch size and data save path
- Initialize the transformer model with your desired configuration and start training
