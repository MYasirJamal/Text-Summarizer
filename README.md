# Text Summarization using Transformers
## Overview
This project implements a text summarization model using transformer-based architectures for efficient information extraction and comprehension. The model is capable of generating concise and coherent summaries of input text documents by leveraging state-of-the-art transformer models.

## Features
- Utilizes transformer-based architectures for text summarization.
- Supports fine-tuning of pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for specific summarization tasks.
- Includes preprocessing steps for tokenization of input text data.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
